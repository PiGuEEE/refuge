<p>Here's Arthur, and my role on Refuge is to make sure we have a hell of a cool website!</p>
<p>This is our brand new layout - which looks WAY BETTER than the old one.</p>
<p>It is still a Work in Progress. The first part to be published was the blog, where we can share with all our friends out there a little bit about our daily work on Refuge.</p>
<p>This site is powered by a cutting-edge framework called Grav! Grav runs on top of PHP, and is way lighter than any other famous php framework - Wordpress, for example.</p>
<p>We're extremely satisfied with what we have accomplished so far, specially myself.</p>
<p>I work mainly as a Web Designer and I can do some Front End development as well. It's being quite of a challenge to get my hands dirty on the back end of sites. It's being a pleasure also to help out the guys focus on their game while I keep an eye on their web presence.</p>
<p>So, if you haven't liked our Facebook page just yet, please do so! Follow the link below:

<p>We will be constantly posting news about the development and even stream some Game Testing sessions live! </p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
