title: 'New Blog is Live!'

Hey there!

Here's Arthur, and my role on Refuge is to make sure we have a hell of a cool website!

This is our brand new layout - which looks WAY BETTER than the old one.

It is still a Work in Progress. The first part to be published was the blog, where we can share with all our friends out there a little bit about our daily work on Refuge.

This site is powered by a cutting-edge framework called Grav! Grav runs on top of PHP, and is way lighter than any other famous php framework - Wordpress, for example.

We're extremely satisfied with what we have accomplished so far, specially myself.

I work mainly as a Web Designer and I can do some Front End development as well. It's being quite of a challenge to get my hands dirty on the back end of sites. It's being a pleasure also to help out the guys focus on their game while I keep an eye on their web presence.

So, if you haven't liked our Facebook page just yet, please do so! Follow the link below:

We will be constantly posting news about the development and even stream some Game Testing sessions live! 

Stay tuned!
