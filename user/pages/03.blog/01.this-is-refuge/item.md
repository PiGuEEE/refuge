Hello! Thank you for visiting the website for the upcoming game, Refuge. 

In Refuge, the player takes control of a bus driver at the end of a smuggling run, trying to get a small group of people back into town without the military noticing. After shit hits the fan, the player becomes responsible for the group of refugees. However many people survive is up to the player. Will you try to save everybody or just yourself? With a dangerous journey ahead, only one thing is certain; Every journey ends.

Stay tuned to read more dev blogs by the team.
